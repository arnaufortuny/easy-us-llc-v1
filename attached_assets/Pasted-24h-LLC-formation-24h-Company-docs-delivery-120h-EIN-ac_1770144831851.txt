Why Incorporate In The US
Trust
Forming a company in the US is viewed as more trustworthy by financial service providers, like Stripe, PayPal and banks due to the nation’s established business infrastructure and stringent regulatory environment.
Protection
A US-based company provides a legal separation between a business and its owners, known as limited liability protection. This means that in the event of lawsuits or debts, personal assets of the owners are generally protected.
Prestige
A US company can lend prestige and credibility to a business. The US is often seen as a leader in innovation and entrepreneurship, and having a US-based company can enhance the reputation of a business both domestically and internationally.
